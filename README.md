## My process


### What I learned

That I have to call in different font-weights, it's not enought just to invite/import only the font itself.

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Red+Hat+Display:wght@500;700;800;900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

I still have problems with weight, due to my small monitor. I have to use smaller font, but it falls below 11px, so weight doesn't work properly.
